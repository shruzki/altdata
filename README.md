The primary project (news sentiment based long short strategy) is in the notebook news-sentiment-long-short.ipynb

A news headlines dataset from kaggle is used and sentiment analysis is performed using the transformer model finBERT. The sentiment scores are used to simulate trades. Performance of this long short strategy (individually and combined with simple moving average strategy) is evaluated.
